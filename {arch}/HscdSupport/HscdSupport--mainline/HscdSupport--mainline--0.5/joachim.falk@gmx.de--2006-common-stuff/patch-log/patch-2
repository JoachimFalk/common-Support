Summary: Merge from joachim.falk@gmx.de--2006-common-stuff/HscdSupport--mainline--0.3:
 Compilefixes (mainly Forte Cynthesizer) and Optimizations
 * arrayfifo.hpp: fixed being friend of itself
 * modulo_arith.hpp: "size_t v" is unsigned, thus remove test "v >= 0"
 * oneof.hpp:
   - include <new> instead of <memory> for in-place new()
   - make oneof_typeid an unsigned char and save some bytes
   - introduce "static const oneof_typeid type" member variable of
     struct oneofTypeid<oneof<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>,T>, which enables some
     compiler optimizations
   - introduce an alignment_dummy in union mem (fixes problems on microbalze)
   - move oneof_typeid oneofTypeid<oneof<T1,T2,T3,T4,T5>,T1>::type from
     namespace CoSupport::detail to CoSupport
   - use switch statements instead of if...else where possible now
