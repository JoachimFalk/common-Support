Summary: 
 * Split cosupport into multiple libraries
 - libcosupport-xerces.la support for xml manipulation with xerces needs -lxercesc
 - libcosupport-systemc.la SystemC support needs -lsystemc
 - libcosupport-filterstream.la debug io streams and filterstreams
 - libcosupport.la the uncategorized rest maybe needs to be split further appart
 * Still missing is the separation of the various header files into groups and
   directories corresponding to their various functions.
